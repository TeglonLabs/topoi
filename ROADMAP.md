## Notes on Theory Integration

The implementation should maintain balance between theoretical correctness and practical usability:

1. Higher-Kinded Types:
   - Focus on practical capability transformations
   - Support common workflow patterns
   - Enable extensible composition

2. Cubical Types:
   - Emphasize practical identity tracking
   - Support basic homotopy operations
   - Enable state transition proofs

3. Observation Bridges:
   - Focus on practical multi-agent scenarios
   - Support common consistency patterns
   - Enable verifiable state merging
