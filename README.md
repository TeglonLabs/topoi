# _

A postmodern exploration of concept space through entropy tensors and random walks.

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸŽ² Random walks through plurigrid repositories
- ðŸŒ€ 3x3x3 entropy tensor visualization with semantic axes
- ðŸ”® Babashka-powered concept exploration
- ðŸ“Š Rich TUI displays with Armenian flair
- ðŸ§¬ Discopy-based categorical structures

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies with uv (modern Python package installer)
just setup

# Run the full experience
just play
```

## What You'll See

1. A random walk through plurigrid repositories, showing interconnected concepts
2. An entropy tensor visualization with three semantic axes:
   - Abstraction (Concrete â†” Abstract)
   - Interaction (Observer â†” Creator)
   - Entropy (Ordered â†” Chaotic)
3. Default startup sequence with rich visualizations

## Development

```bash
# Clean build artifacts
just clean

# Run tests
just test

# Build package
just build

# Publish to PyPI
just publish
```

## Metatheory

The project is evolving towards a color-io based metatheory where:
- Random walks generate meaning
- Entropy becomes visualization
- Categories meet computation
- Color flows define interaction

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! Some areas of interest:
- Color-io metatheory extensions
- New semantic axes for the entropy tensor
- Alternative visualization approaches
- Integration with other categorical structures
