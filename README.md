An operating metasystem exploring dependency space through entropy tensors and random walks.

## Telos

The system evolves through incremental branching points in possible world continuations, using balanced ternary decisions to navigate the dependency space. Each choice point represents a potential trajectory in the evolution of the operating metasystem:

- Flox path (successor): Full reproducible environment
- Current path (stabilizer): Preserve existing state
- Babashka path (predecessor): Progressive enhancement

## Prerequisites

- **Flox** OR **Babashka** (system will use one based on random walk)
  - [Install Flox](https://flox.dev/docs/install)
  - [Install Babashka](https://babashka.org/install)

The system performs a balanced ternary coin-flip to determine the optimal installation path. You only need one prerequisite - the metasystem handles trajectory selection.

## ‚ú® Features

- üé≤ Random walks through dependency space using Monte Carlo rollouts
- üåÄ 3x3x3 entropy / control tensor visualization with semantic axes
- üîÆ Babashka-powered concept exploration
- üìä Rich TUI displays with arm/acc tendencies
- üß¨ Discopy-based categorical structures
- üîÑ Automatic backup and state preservation
- ‚ö° Progressive MCP server installation
- üõ†Ô∏è Configurable installation paths

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install based on coin-flip decision
just install   # Will flip coin to decide:
              # +1: Use Flox (successor)
              #  0: Use current MCP client (stabilizer)
              # -1: Use Babashka (predecessor)

# Run the full experience
just play
```

## Installation Process

The installation process uses a balanced ternary coin-flip to determine the optimal trajectory:
- On +1: Full Flox-based installation (successor state)
- On 0: Use current MCP client with pseudo-operational semantics (stabilizer)
- On -1: Full Babashka-based installation (predecessor state)

This three-way choice reflects the categorical nature of our system:
- Flox path: Full reproducible environment
- Current path: Preserve existing state
- Babashka path: Progressive enhancement

```bash
# Manual override options (if needed)
just install-flox
just install-current
just install-babashka
```

## Configuration

The system uses EDN-based configuration (config.edn) for customizing:
- Installation paths
- Bootstrap preferences
- Server priorities
- Working memory location
- Development settings

Default configuration creates all necessary directories under ~/topos, but this is fully configurable.

## What You'll See

1. A random walk through dependency space, showing interconnected concepts
2. An entropy tensor visualization with three semantic axes:
   - Abstraction (Concrete ‚Üî Abstract)
   - Interaction (Observer ‚Üî Creator)
   - Entropy (Ordered ‚Üî Chaotic)
3. Default startup sequence with rich visualizations

## Development

```bash
# Clean build artifacts
just clean

# Run tests
just test

# Build package
just build

# Create backup
bb -m topos-mcp.core --mode backup

# Publish to PyPI
just publish
```

## Metatheory

The project evolves through a color-io based metatheory where:
- Random walks generate meaning
- Entropy becomes visualization
- Categories meet computation
- Color flows define interaction

## MCP Servers

Progressive installation of MCP servers in priority order:
1. coin-flip: Random decision making
2. say: Voice interaction (using Serena Premium)
3. qemu: System emulation
4. babashka: Clojure scripting
5. github: Repository management
6. anti-bullshit: Validation framework
7. manifold: Prediction markets

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! Some areas of interest:
- Color-io metatheory extensions
- New semantic axes for the entropy tensor
- Alternative visualization approaches
- Integration with other categorical structures
- New MCP server implementations
