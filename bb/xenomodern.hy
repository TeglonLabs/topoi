  This script demonstrates a Hy-based approach to a “random coin flip”
  that always lands on the same side—a “one-sided coin.” It references
  an invented concept “xenomodern beh” in a simple variable.
  The user also mentioned “uv add textual,” but we have no specific
  direct references. This is a minimal skeleton you could extend to
  integrate actual logic or libraries (e.g., textual TUI or topos-mcp).)

(def xenomodern "beh")

(defn one-sided-coin []
  "Heads")  ; Always returns "Heads", no real randomness

(defn -main [&rest argv]
  (print "One-sided coin says:" (one-sided-coin))
  (print "xenomodern is set to:" xenomodern))
