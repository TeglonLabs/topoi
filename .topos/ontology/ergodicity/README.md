# Ergodicity

Ergodicity describes systems where time averages equal ensemble averages over long periods.

## Properties

### Time Invariance
- Statistical stability
- Predictable behavior
- Consistent patterns

### Space Exploration
- State coverage
- Path independence
- Phase transitions

### Convergence
- Limit behavior
- Equilibrium states
- Stability conditions

## Application in MCP

- System behavior prediction
- Resource optimization
- State space management
- Long-term planning
