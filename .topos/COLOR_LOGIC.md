# Color Logic Integration Notes

## Core Concepts from color-logic.io

Color Logic is a formal system for reasoning about color relationships and transformations in a categorical framework. Key aspects include:

1. Color as Type
   - Colors are treated as types in a dependent type system
   - RGB/HSL spaces become type constructors
   - Color mixing as type intersection

2. Logical Operations
   ```haskell
   type ColorMix = forall a b. Color a -> Color b -> Color (a ∩ b)
   type ColorComplement = forall a. Color a -> Color (¬a)
   ```

3. Categorical Structure
   - Colors form objects in a category
   - Color transformations are morphisms
   - Composition preserves harmony rules

## Integration Points with _

Our entropy tensor can be extended with color logic:

```
Tensor[i,j,k] :: Color(Entropy) -> Color(Visualization)
```

Where:
- Abstraction axis maps to color temperature
- Interaction axis maps to color saturation
- Entropy axis maps to color brightness

## Planned Features

1. Color-logic based type checking for tensor operations
2. Harmony-preserving random walks
3. Category-theoretic visualization of color spaces
