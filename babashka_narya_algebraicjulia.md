# Using Narya, CatColab, and AlgebraicJulia from Babashka, with Runtime Switching and Visual Self-Editing

This document sketches out a plan for:
1. Integrating the Narya, CatColab, and AlgebraicJulia ecosystems into a Babashka workflow.  
2. Dynamically switching or embedding multiple runtimes (e.g. Clojure, Julia, Python) from Babashka.  
3. Setting up an environment reminiscent of “Cline-like” visual self-editing, where files can be automatically updated in an editor buffer in real-time.

## 1. The Narya Ecosystem

### What is Narya?
• Narya is a codebase that extends or modifies deep learning frameworks (often PyTorch) with specialized features focusing on interpretability, or a specific neural architecture.  
• Typically invoked from Python scripts or notebooks.  

### Babashka Integration
• Babashka runs on Clojure and can script external processes.  
• One approach is to call Python scripts containing Narya logic from Babashka (via clojure.java.shell or the bb “process” library).  
• Alternatively, if the user wants deeper integration, consider bridging through an RPC approach (like nREPL, with a Python-based server).  

### Potential Steps
1. Write minimal Python entry points for Narya-based tasks (say, “narya_train.py,” “narya_inference.py”).  
2. In Babashka, define tasks that run these scripts with arguments.  
   - Example:  
     ```clojure
     (defn run-narya-train [params]
       (shell/sh "python3" "narya_train.py" (str params)))
     ```  
3. Capture the output or logs in Babashka to feed into other tasks or to store in local databases.

## 2. CatColab (Categorical Collaboratory)

### What is CatColab?
• CatColab might refer to a “Collaboratory” focusing on category theory in the Cloud, possibly hooking into Jupyter or Docker-based environments for interactive categorical modeling.  
• If it’s Python-based (like an extension of a Colab environment), the Babashka integration is somewhat similar to Narya: calling Python or hooking into a Jupyter kernel.  

### Using from Babashka
• If CatColab is a web-based or container-based environment, we can:
  1. Launch or control it via Docker or CLI from Babashka.  
  2. Possibly push/pull data using an HTTP or WebSocket interface.  
• If there is a direct library (a .jar or .cljc?), we can attempt to integrate it natively. But often, these category theory frameworks are specialized to Python + Jupyter.

### Potential Steps
1. Create a minimal script that interacts with CatColab (maybe “catcolab.py”).  
2. Babashka can orchestrate container-based runs or call that script.

## 3. AlgebraicJulia

### Overview
• AlgebraicJulia is a set of Julia libraries for compositional modeling, category theory-based transformations, etc.  
• Chiefly developed in Julia, using libraries like Catlab.jl, AlgebraicPetri.jl, etc.  
• Catlab.jl is a framework for applied category theory in Julia, used for graph rewriting, Petri nets, circuit composition, etc.

### Babashka + Julia
• Babashka doesn’t run Julia code natively, but we can shell out to “julia <some_script>.jl.”  
• For deeper bridging, one might consider the Julia nREPL or Ilua approach, but that’s more experimental.  
• Alternatively, name-based pipes or a simple RPC approach can connect a persistent Julia process to Babashka.

### Potential Steps
1. Write “algebraic_pipeline.jl” that performs a category-based transformation in AlgebraicJulia.  
2. Babashka triggers that script with parameters, capturing the output.  
3. For advanced live interaction, keep the Julia process running in the background, sending commands dynamically from Babashka.

## 4. Switching Runtimes

### Why Switch Runtimes?
• We want a single orchestrator (Babashka) that can call Python for Narya, call Julia for AlgebraicJulia, and maybe do local Clojure tasks.  
• Each environment might be best at certain tasks (ML in Python, category theory in Julia, system automation in Babashka).  

### Approaches
1. **Shell out**: The simplest approach. For each step, run “python script.py,” “julia script.jl,” or a compiled “clj -M mytask.clj.”  
2. **Long-Lived Processes**: Keep a Python process or a Julia process running, communicate with them over standard I/O or sockets. More complex, but more interactive.  
3. **Containerized**: If each environment is Docker-based, Babashka can spin up and tear down containers.  

### Example of a Shell Approach in `bb.edn`:
```clojure
{:tasks
 {
  :narya-train
   (fn [params]
     (shell/sh "python3" "narya_train.py" (str params)))

  :algebraic-run
   (fn [graph-file]
     (shell/sh "julia" "algebraic_pipeline.jl" graph-file))
 }}
```

## 5. Cline-Like Visual Self-Editing

### Concept
• “Cline-like” visual self-editing suggests a mode in which the system can show the user an editor buffer as it changes. Possibly, code lines are visually manipulated in real time.  
• We can replicate partial functionality by:
  - Doing search/replace in files with Babashka (like we do with the “replace_in_file” approach in this environment).
  - Exposing a TUI or web UI that refreshes on each change, showing a diff or updated code.  

### Tools & Steps
1. **Babashka File Edits**: Babashka can parse a file, apply changes, write it back.  
2. **In-Editor Display**: If using Visual Studio Code, we can manually update the file and rely on the user’s editor to show diffs.  
3. **Custom TUI**: Implement a curses-based UI in Babashka to simulate an editor that shows lines, highlighting changes.  

### Example Flow
- The user requests an edit.  
- Babashka runs a function that modifies the file on disk.  
- The TUI automatically reloads the file content, displays a diff, and possibly highlights what changed.  

### Future Directions
- Potential integration with nREPL-based or language server protocols that can directly update the user’s editor buffer.  
- Web-based approach: Start a ring server from Babashka that serves an HTML page showing the file’s contents, polls for changes, and updates in real time.

## Summary

1. **Narya (Python) + CatColab (Python) + AlgebraicJulia (Julia)**: The easiest path is orchestrating each from Babashka using shell-based calls, or a more sophisticated approach with persistent processes.  
2. **Runtime Switching**: Centralize all tasks in a single `bb.edn`, referencing “python3,” “julia,” or “clojure” invocations.  
3. **Cline-Like Self-Editing**: Implement a Babashka-based TUI or web UI that, upon file modifications, displays the changes. This simulates a “visual editor buffer,” though it’s conceptually simpler to rely on an external editor plus the “replace_in_file” pattern.  

By combining these, we get a flexible environment letting us selectively run advanced Python ML (Narya, CatColab) or advanced Julia category frameworks (AlgebraicJulia), all orchestrated from a single Babashka script, and potentially visually showing code changes as they happen.
