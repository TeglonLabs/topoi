# === Triplet Structure ===

The VSCode environment presents three synchronized views:

1. File Explorer View (Visible Files)
   - Current files visible in the sidebar
   - Represents immediate workspace context
   - Example: @.continue/prompts/new-prompt-file.prompt

2. Editor State (Open Tabs)
   - All currently open editor tabs
   - Represents active work context
   - Example: @src/topos_mcp/server.py

3. Working Directory (CWD)
   - Files in current working directory
   - Represents available resources
   - Example: @justfile

# === Navigation Context ===

The environment provides these views through:
- VSCode Visible Files: Current explorer view
- VSCode Open Tabs: Active editor tabs
- Current Working Directory: Available files

# === Model Configuration ===

Available models form another triplet:
1. Claude 3 Sonnet (Anthropic) - Default
2. Qwen QwQ 32B (Ollama) - Alternative
3. GPT-4o (OpenAI) - Specialized

# === Template Usage ===

When working in this environment:
1. Reference files using @ notation
2. Consider all three views for context
3. Navigate between views as needed

Example task template:

- Open editor tabs
- Working directory state

# === Original Template Reference ===
# A prompt file consists of two parts:
# 1. Everything above the "---" is YAML. Here you can set "temperature", "description", and other options
# 2. Everything below the "---" is the prompt body

# In the body, you can reference:
# 1. Files, using either absolute or relative paths (based on the workspace root)
  # @README.md
  # @src/test/test.py
# 2. URLs, for example
  # 'https://example.com' 
# 3. Context providers, for example
  # @currentFile
  # @os
  # @repo-map
